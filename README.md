🛒 Walmart Sales Dashboard (Power BI)
This project demonstrates my ability to solve complex business problems using data visualization and analytical reasoning. Built in Power BI, the dashboard analyzes Walmart’s retail performance across time, geography, product categories, and shipping modes—transforming raw data into actionable insights for decision-makers.
🧠 Problem Statement
Walmart needed a way to:
- Monitor sales, profit, and quantity trends across multiple cities and time periods
- Identify underperforming categories and shipping methods
- Correlate discount strategies with profitability
- Enable dynamic, self-service reporting for business users
🔍 My Problem-Solving Approach
- Data Structuring: Cleaned and modeled raw sales data to establish relationships between time, region, product, and shipping dimensions.
- KPI Design: Defined key metrics (Total Sales, Profit, Quantity, Average Sales) to track performance at a glance.
- Trend Analysis: Used line charts and slicers to uncover monthly and weekday patterns in sales and quantity.
- Geographic Insights: Mapped city-wise sales to highlight regional strengths and gaps.
